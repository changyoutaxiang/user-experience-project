# Tasks: 用户体验拯救项目群管理系统

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ux-rescue-pm-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No specific test requirements in specification - focusing on implementation tasks

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Backend: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- Frontend: TypeScript 5.x with React 18
- Database: PostgreSQL 15+

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3 - P1)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4 - P1)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5 - P2)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion + User Story 2 (needs Project model)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6 - P2)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion + User Story 2 (needs Project model)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7 - P3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion + all previous stories (logs all operations)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - 仪表盘)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable
- **User Story 2 (P1 - 项目管理)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2 - 任务管理)**: Requires User Story 2 complete (tasks belong to projects) - Independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2 - 预算跟踪)**: Requires User Story 2 complete (expenses belong to projects) - Independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3 - 人员管理)**: Can start after Foundational, but audit logging should be added after other stories - Independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before API routes
- API routes before frontend services
- Frontend services before components
- Components before pages
- Core implementation before integration

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup) - All parallel**:
- Tasks T003, T004, T005, T006, T009, T010 can all run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational) - Many parallel within constraints**:

- T071, T072 can run in parallel
- Frontend: T077, T078, T079, T080, T081, T082 can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (User Story 4) - Parallel within constraints**:
- T087, T088 can run in parallel
- Frontend: T092, T093, T094, T095, T096 can run in parallel

**Phase 8 (Polish) - Many parallel**:
- T111, T112, T113, T114, T117, T118, T119, T120 can all run in parallel

**Full Team Parallelization**:
Once Foundational (Phase 2) is complete:
- Team A: User Story 1 (Phase 3)
- Team B: User Story 2 (Phase 4)
Then:
- Team C: User Story 3 (Phase 5) - after Team B completes US2
- Team D: User Story 4 (Phase 6) - after Team B completes US2
Finally:
- Team E: User Story 5 (Phase 7) - after all others complete

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (仪表盘)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (项目管理)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both user stories independently and together
6. Deploy/demo if ready - This is the MVP!

**MVP Value**:
- ✅ 管理员可以查看项目群总览
- ✅ 管理员可以创建、管理项目
- ✅ 管理员可以分配项目成员
- ✅ 管理员和成员可以关联飞书文档到项目
- ✅ 系统显示预算和逾期警告

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. **MVP Release** (Phases 3-4): Add User Stories 1 & 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
3. **V2 Release** (Phases 5-6): Add User Stories 3 & 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. **V3 Release** (Phase 7): Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. **Production Ready** (Phase 8): Polish & optimization → Final deployment

Each release adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

**Week 1-2: Foundation (All team together)**
1. Complete Setup (Phase 1)
2. Complete Foundational (Phase 2)

**Week 3-4: MVP (Parallel work begins)**
- Developer A: User Story 1 (Phase 3)
- Developer B: User Story 2 (Phase 4)

**Week 5-6: V2 Features (Parallel work)**
- Developer C: User Story 3 (Phase 5) - starts after US2 completes
- Developer D: User Story 4 (Phase 6) - starts after US2 completes

**Week 7: V3 Feature**
- Developer E: User Story 5 (Phase 7)

**Week 8: Polish**
- All team: Phase 8 polish tasks in parallel

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 125

**By Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 10 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 22 tasks
- Phase 3 (User Story 1 - P1): 11 tasks
- Phase 4 (User Story 2 - P1): 27 tasks
- Phase 5 (User Story 3 - P2): 16 tasks
- Phase 6 (User Story 4 - P2): 13 tasks
- Phase 7 (User Story 5 - P3): 11 tasks
- Phase 8 (Polish): 15 tasks

**By User Story**:
- User Story 1 (项目群总览和导航): 11 tasks
- User Story 2 (项目创建和管理): 27 tasks
- User Story 3 (任务管理): 16 tasks
- User Story 4 (预算跟踪): 13 tasks
- User Story 5 (人员和权限管理): 11 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 60+ tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase constraints

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-4 (70 tasks) delivers working dashboard and project management

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- ✅ US1: Dashboard displays project stats and navigation works
- ✅ US2: Projects can be created, edited, members assigned, documents linked
- ✅ US3: Tasks can be created, assigned, tracked; "My Tasks" view works
- ✅ US4: Budget can be set, expenses recorded, overspending alerts shown
- ✅ US5: Users can be managed, roles assigned, audit logs viewed

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within same phase
- [Story] label (US1, US2, etc.) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Tests were not explicitly requested in specification, focusing on implementation
- All database migrations should be reversible (support rollback)
- Follow constitution principles: spec-driven, incremental delivery, testability
- Document API endpoints will auto-generate via FastAPI's OpenAPI integration
